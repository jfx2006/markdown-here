Highlightjs is used for syntax highlighting source code in the rendered
HTML.
It's not the easiest thing to download and customize what languages are
supported, so I wrote tools/get-highlightjs.sh to build from source.
That script also generates a styles.json file which is used in the
options page in the syntax style selection.

marked.js
I downloaded from the git repository since the Marked.js
documentation says to download from a CDN.... Version 2.0.1 is the latest
as of Feb 28 2021.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markedjs/marked/v2.0.1/lib/marked.js

jsHtmlToText.js
I cannot locate a current version of this library, so this is the same
one from the markdown-here repository. There are several candidates to
replace it.

Use of mailextension experiments:
The notificationbar experiment from https://github.com/jobisoft/notificationbar-API
is used.
