Highlightjs is used for syntax highlighting source code in the rendered
HTML.
It's not the easiest thing to download and customize what languages are
supported, so I wrote tools/get-highlightjs.sh to build from source.
That script also generates a styles.json file which is used in the
options page in the syntax style selection.

I cannot locate a current version of this library, so this is the same
one from the markdown-here repository. There are several candidates to
replace it.

Use of mailextension experiments:
The notificationbar experiment from https://github.com/jobisoft/notificationbar-API
is used.

Options UI pages:
- mailext-options-sync:
  This is a project that I forked and removed some functionality from. The final built
  file that's included in the extension can be downloaded from:
  https://gitlab.com/jfx2006/mailext-options-sync/-/blob/v2.1.2/mailext-options-sync.js

  Additionally, the source for the included version is in the uploaded tar file.
  The MDHR Makefile will build mailext-options-sync and copy it into src/options.
  Version 2.1.2 was built with node 14.17.0 and npm 6.14.13
