# Customui experiment notes

This is a slightly modified version of the customui mailextension experiment
from https://github.com/rsjtdrjgfuzkfg/thunderbird-experiments.

A new sidebar location was added: "LOCATION_COMPOSE_EDITOR". The 
"LOCATION_COMPOSE" fills the entire height of the compose window, while
"LOCATION_COMPOSE_EDITOR" is the height of the editor portion of the
window.
