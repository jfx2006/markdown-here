## Code contributions

Markdown Here Revival (for Thunderbird) will use GitLab and whatever tools
that make sense. At the moment that is just the Git repository.

I plan to use the Wiki for documentation.

Bug reports and feature requests can go in the issue tracker, and pull requests
are encouraged!

## Contributor Conduct

I would think that in 2021 wr can be adults and respect one another regardless
of whatever.

### Contributor license agreement

All contributions must be somehow MIT compatible for now; I intend to look at
relicensing so that we don't need to maintain who has the copyright on what where.
It's open source, that sort of thing is silly.

## Translation

There is a [separate repository](https://gitlab.com/jfx2006/mdhr-i18n)
for i18n strings. See that repo's README.md file. The short version is,
use [WET](https://github.com/Lusito/web-ext-translator) to make your changes
and either send a pull request or create an issue and upload a ZIP file.
